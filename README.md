# Recap Project V: Art Gallery App

In this recap project I created an art gallery app.

There is an API that provides all art pieces to show in the gallery:

https://example-apis.vercel.app/api/art
Each item given by the API will include an URL to the image of the art piece. Use the next/image component to display the image. Don't forget to add the domain example-apis.vercel.app to the Next.js config file. Refer to the handout of the Session Next.js Basics and Routing for help (always restart the dev server after a config change).

Besides the art pieces themselves, your gallery app needs to handle data that changes on user interaction. You are required to establish a state to store additional information, that is linked to the art pieces given by the API. Please refer to the handout of the session React Data Fetching for guidance.

The following user stories define the features you should add to the app. We advise you to work on the user stories roughly in the order they are noted here. Some user stories depend on each other. Some can be implemented independently.

Create a new repository on GitHub and add everybody in your group as collaborator. When starting with the app you should implement the basic setup in a mob. Afterwards you should split up. Each group member can contribute parts to the app individually or in pair programming. Use different branches and pull requests to work in parallel.

Plan your work wisely and talk about your next steps in the team.

The goal of this recap project is not necessarily to finish all features, but to write clean code with isolated components that are tested well. The acceptance criteria of the user stories point out requirements that should be covered by component testing. It is advised to follow the noted tasks in each user story.
